        ## üß† Python Variables

                       In Python, **variables** are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated later in your code.
                       You don‚Äôt need to declare the type‚ÄîPython is **dynamically typed**, so it figures it out for you.

        üìù Creating Variables

         python
               name = "Arun"       # string
                age = 20             # integer
                height = 5.6         # float
                is_student = True    # boolean

               Python uses `=` to assign values.


               üìå Rules for Variable Names

                         * Must start with a **letter** or an **underscore (`_`)**
                         * Cannot start with a number
                         * Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
                         * Are **case-sensitive** (`Name` and `name` are different)

                         ‚úÖ Valid:

                                      python
                                          user_name = "Bob"
                                           _age = 30


                         ‚ùå Invalid:

                                      python
                                           2name = "Error"     # starts with number
                                            user-name = "Error" # hyphen not allowed




                         üîÑ Reassigning & Dynamic Typing

                               Variables can change type at runtime:

                              python
                              
                                    x = 42       # int
                                    x = "hello"  # now it's a string



                          üìö Variable Types (Built-in)

                                         | Type    | Example                  |
                                         | ------- | ------------------------ |
                                         | `int`   | `x = 10`                 |
                                         | `float` | `pi = 3.14`              |
                                         | `str`   | `name = "Eve"`           |
                                         | `bool`  | `is_valid = True`        | 
                                         | `list`  | `nums = [1, 2, 3]`       |
                                         |  `dict` | `user = {"name": "Max"}` |

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Use **meaningful names** (e.g. `user_age` instead of `ua`)
* Use **snake\_case** for variable names
* Avoid using Python **keywords** as variable names (e.g. `class`, `def`, `if`)

                                    In python, variables are used to store the data that can be referenced
                    What is a variable ?

                        a VARIABLE in python is like a container used to store data
                        you can assign values using = operator

                           PYTHON

                                 name = "Arun"
                                 age = 20
                                 is_student = True
